## ‚ùîDefining the problem

Have you ever wondered **how to effectively manage server state in your Flutter apps**? Many developers resort to using Riverpod, Bloc, `FutureBuilder``, or any other general-purpose state management solution. However, these solutions often lead to writing repetitive code that handles data fetching, caching, and other logic.

The truth is, general-purpose state management solutions are not the best choice when it comes to handling asynchronous server state. This is due to the **unique nature of server state - it is asynchronous and requires specific APIs for fetching and updating**. Additionally, the server state is stored in a remote location, which means **it can be modified without your knowledge from anywhere in the world**. This alone requires a lot of effort to keep the data synchronized and ensure that it is up-to-date.

### How does ‚ö°fquery tackle this problem?

[fquery](https://github.com/41y08h/fquery) is powered by [flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks). It is very similar to [swr](https://github.com/vercel/swr) and [react-query](https://github.com/tanstack/query). With fquery, you can make use of easy-to-use hooks to retrieve data from a Future and the rest of the process is automated. [fquery](https://github.com/41y08h/fquery) is highly configurable, allowing you to customize it to meet your specific needs. You can configure every aspect of it to make it work optimally for your use case.

## üìÑ Example

Here's a very simple widget that makes use of the `useQuery` hook:

```dart
class Posts extends HookWidget {
  const Posts({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final posts = useQuery(['posts'], getPosts);

    return Builder(
      builder: (context) {
        if (posts.isLoading) {
          return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
        }

        if (posts.isError) {
          return Center(child: Text(posts.error!.toString()));
        }

        return ListView.builder(
          itemCount: posts.data!.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            final post = posts.data![index];
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(post.title),
            );
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

You'll need to install [flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) before you can start using this library. You'll need to wrap
your entire app inside a `QueryClientProvider` and you are good to go.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    QueryClientProvider(
      queryClient: queryClient,
      child: CupertinoApp(
```

### Queries

To query data in your widgets, you'll need to extend the widget using `HookWidget` or `StatefulHookWidget` (for stateful widgets). These classes are exported from the [flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) package.

A query instance is a subscription to asynchronous data stored in the cache. Every query needs -

- A **Query key**, uniquely identifies the query stored in the cache.
- A `Future` that either resolves or throws an error

The same query key can be used in multiple instances of the `useQuery` hook and the data will be shared throughout the app.

```dart
Future<List<Post>> getPosts() async {
  final res = await Dio().get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  return (res.data as List)
      .map((e) => Post.fromJson(e as Map<String, dynamic>))
      .toList();
}

class Posts extends HookWidget {
  const Posts({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final posts = useQuery(['posts'], getPosts);
```

The returned value of the `useQuery` hook is an instance of `UseQueryResult` and contains all the information related to that query. A `Builder` widget comes in handy when rendering the results.

```dart
// The query has no data to display
if (posts.isLoading) {
  return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
}

// An error has occurred
if (posts.isError) {
  return Center(child: Text(posts.error!.toString()));
}

// Success, data is ready to display
return ListView.builder(
  itemCount: posts.data!.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    final post = posts.data![index];
    return ListTile(
      title: Text(post.title),
    );
  },
);
```

### Query configuration

A query is fully customizable to match your needs, these configurations can be passed as named parameters into the `useQuery` hook

```dart
// These are default configurations
final posts = useQuery(
  ['posts'],
  getPosts,
  enabled: true,
  cacheDuration: const Duration(minutes: 5),
  refetchInterval: null // The query will not re-fetch by default,
  refetchOnMount: RefetchOnMount.stale,
  staleDuration: const Duration(seconds: 10),
);
```

- `enabled` - specifies if the query fetcher function is automatically called when the widget renders and can be used for _dependent queries_.
- `cacheDuration` - specifies the duration unused/inactive cache data remains in memory; the cached data will be garbage collected after this duration. The longest duration will be used when different values are specified in multiple instances of the query.
- `refetchInterval` - specifies the time interval in which all queries will re-fetch the data, setting it to `null` (default) will turn off re-fetching.
- `refetchOnMount` - specifies the behavior of the query instance when the widget is first built and the data is already available.
  - `RefetchOnMount.always` - will always refetch when the widget is built.
  - `RefetchOnMount.stale` - will fetch the data if it is stale (see `staleDuration`).
  - `RefetchOnMount.never` - will never refetch.
- `staleDuration` - specifies the duration until the data becomes stale. This value applies to each query instance individually.

### Dependent Query

A dependent query is a query that depends on another variable for execution, or even any other query. Probably you want to run a query only after some other query, or data in a query that you don't have, e.g. a `Future`, or to fetch data only when a variable takes a certain value, e.g. a `bool` like `isAuthenticated`, for all of this or similar, dependent query can ease your load. To use this, simply pass the `enabled` option.

```dart
final user = useQuery(['users', email], getUserByEmail);

// This query will not execute until the above is successful and the username is available
final username = user.data?.username;
final posts = useQuery(['posts', ], getPosts, enabled: !username);


final isAuthenticated = session != null;
final keys = useQuery(['keys', session.id], enabled: isAuthenticated)
```

### Query invalidation

This technique can be used to manually mark the cached data as stale and potentially even re-fetch them. This is especially useful when you know that the data has been changed. `QueryClient` (see [below](#queryclient)) has an `invalidateQueries()` method that allows you to do that. **You can make use of the `useQueryClient` hook to obtain the instance of `QueryClient`** that you passed with `QueryClientProvider`.

```dart
final queryClient = useQueryClient();

// Invalidate every query with a key that starts with `post`
queryClient.invalidateQueries(['posts']);

// here, both queries will be invalidated
final posts = useQuery(['posts'], getPosts);
final post = useQuery(['posts', 1], getPosts);


// Use `exact: true` to exactly match the query
queryClient.invalidateQueries(['posts'], exact: true);

// here, only this will invalidate
final posts = useQuery(['posts'], getPosts);
```

When a query is invalidated, two things will happen:

- It marks it as stale and this overrides any `staleDuration` configuration passed to `useQuery`.
- If the query is being used in a widget, it will be re-fetched, otherwise, it will be re-fetched when it is used by a widget at a later point in time.

### Manual updates

You probably already know how the data is changed and don't want to re-fetch the whole data again. You can set it manually using the `setQueryData()` method on the `QueryClient`. It takes a query key and an updater function. If the query data doesn't exist already in the cache (that's why `previous` is nullable), it'll be created.

```dart
final queryClient = useQueryClient();

// The `Type` of returned data must match the `Type` of data
// stored in the cache, otherwise an error will be thrown
queryClient.setQueryData<List<Post>>(['posts'], (previous) {
  return previous?.map((post) {
    return post.copyWith(
      title: "lorem ipsum"
    );
  }).toList() ?? <Post>[]
})
```

### QueryClient

A `QueryClient` is used to interact with the query cache. It is made available throughout the app using a `QueryClientProvider`. **It can be configured to change the default configurations of the queries.**

```dart
final queryClient = QueryClient(
  defaultQueryOptions: DefaultQueryOptions(
    cacheDuration: Duration(minutes: 20),
    refetchInterval: Duration(minutes: 5),
    refetchOnMount: RefetchOnMount.always,
    staleDuration: Duration(minutes: 3),
  ),
);

void main() {
  runApp(
    QueryClientProvider(
      queryClient: queryClient,
      child: CupertinoApp(
```
