## Contribution guide



Thanks for investing your time in contributing to our project, *your contribution to this project means a **lot***.

This project is still in its beta version for a long time now, and unfortunately, I'm not able to find time to contribute to this project. 

If you want to contribute to this project and take it to the next version, you're very welcome âœ¨.

## Getting started 

To get an overview of the project, you can start by looking at the [src](lib/src) directory. 

It is heavily inspired by [TanStack Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query) *(formerly known as react-query)*.

If you need any help with this, you can contact me at [my discord profile](https://discord.com/users/Piyush#5594).
